## Project Brief

**Purpose:** Build a project tracker that can have multiple goals and various types of goals. (Words, Hours, Pages, etc).  There should be a public facing page that has an about me, contact, books, and work in project page with an additional link to an external blog.  The Work in progress page should show all active goals. The admin section should be able to create new projects, and new goals as well as create new Project Statuses and Goal Types.  A Progress chart would be nice.  In later revisions the ability to add books will be required -- but not at this time as there are no books to display -- a coming soon section is perfectly acceptable.

**Deliverables**
- A logo
- A front facing webpage design
- A simple backend dashboard with a single user
- The word tracking app in the dashboard
