## Project Brief

This project was the bulk of what I managed for the timeI was with Baber's Inc.  It grew as business needs changed, and peices came and went as needed. The purpose of the intranet was a place to store all relavent reports, and modules that helped stores and locations preform their duties with efficiency.

This project has undergone three major revisions.

The first version I wrote was based on CodeIngitor 2.  Below is a list of modules created.

- Key Metric reports
- Inventory Ordering System
- Credit Card Reconciliation/Expense reports
- Create document location sharing system
- Commissions/Bonus System
- Field Receipt Book management system
- RAL check printing (Early refund checks/loans for Taxes)
- Project management system for Construction Crew
- Module for an Exchange Lease program to augment the third party POS
- Various Marketing Campaing manager for babers.com website
- Many reports

Version 2 of the Intranet was created in Laravel 4 and has since been upgraded and is currently running 7.0 at time of writing this.

- A petty cash system
- Digital uploads of all signed agreements
- Customer Reward program interfaces for internal/external - first

- Rewrote inventory ordering interface

Version 3 of the intranet was created in Laravel with a modular approach to systems when the company decided to separate individual companes into their own entites.  The entire system was rewritten in Laravel and Vue under this modualar approach that allows the configuration and module loaded to be domain specific.

- Commissions system was written to enable faster loading of individual sales
